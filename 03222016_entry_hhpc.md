Today:
* Calculated OCC for aredi simulations
* Made plot of global and southern ocean heat content for aredi simulations

Note: Aredi = 800 mixing case has a drift in the global carbon content (model was not spun up long enough). This drift has been removed in the Aredi = 800 mixing case. Additionally, the drift slope on the 800 case has been subtracted from the 400 and 2400 simulations.
