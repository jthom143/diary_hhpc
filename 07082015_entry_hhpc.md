Today: 
* Finished trend analysis for 850 mb jet magnitude and location. 
* Compared trend analysis between variables: SAM, SSTs, and westerly jet

### Trend Analysis Comparison: 

SAM Trends                 |  SST Trends

### Results: 
* Trend PDFs are similar for both mixing cases for the SAM and westerly jet metrics, but not for SSTs. 
* SST variability under the high mixing case is much smaller than the low mixing case. 
* Suggests the changes going on in the ocean in these different mixing cases is not changing the atmospheric dynamics substantially. 
* Look further in ocean fields including stratification. 
  * First look into the mixed layer depths (defined by sigma-t and mixing scheme). 
  * Next look into vertical denisty gradient (ref: Capotondi et al., 2012). 
    * Difference between density at 200m and surface density (200m is below average MLD).
 
## Mixed Layer Depth using mixing scheme 
Aredi = 400                |  Aredi = 2400
