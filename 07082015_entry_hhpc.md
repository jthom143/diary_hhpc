Today: 
* Finished trend analysis for 850 mb jet magnitude and location. 
* Compared trend analysis between variables: SAM, SSTs, and westerly jet

### Trend Analysis Comparison:

### Results: 
* Trend PDFs are similar for both mixing cases for the SAM and westerly jet metrics, but not for SSTs. 
* SST variability under the high mixing case is much smaller than the low mixing case. 
* Suggests the changes going on in the ocean in these different mixing cases is not changing the atmospheric dynamics substantially. 
* Look further in ocean fields including stratification.
