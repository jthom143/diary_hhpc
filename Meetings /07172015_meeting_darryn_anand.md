Meeting with Darryn and Anand: 

Two schools of thought: 
* Winds drive everything 
* Convection (winter-time) changes the surface temperature ect. 

To do: 
* Look at corrlelations in addition to trends
* Look at winter-time mixed depth and stratification. 

SST variability is smaller in high mixing case because there is no sea 
ice to drive convection. 
* Sea ice should decrease as aredi increases... leading to less 
convective events (winter-time). 

Papers to look at: 
*How does the redi parameter for mesoscale mixing impact global climate 
in an ESM? 

Hypothesis: 
* What drives the SSTs:
  * Winds drive SSTs during austral summer. 
  * Convection drives SSTs during austral winter. 
* Is the response to the winds fundamentally different in different 
model runs? 

Think about a dynamical or biogeochemical question: 
* General questions I would like to answer
* What model runs I would need to do or analyze 
* Develop a "plan of attack"
* Definitely have a list of runs I would like to do with the NCAR model before the workshop. 

To Do List: 
* **Email Ute about SSTs**
* Look at potential density instead of in situ density.
