Differences in carbon uptake in the aredi runs is due to increased ventilation (in higher mixing run).
Age of water less than 200 years tracked the changes in carbon uptake.  

Make the plots that show that the age is changing in the different mixing runs. 
* Age less than 200 years
* Preformed nutrients (DIC-pre tracer, preformed phosphate)

Why is there no difference in heat uptake when there is a difference in carbon uptake? 
Depth vs latitude - temperature, carbon, and age changes between mixing runs. 

1. Look at the corellation between age and carbon flux in the no-circulation change 
  * Create an "anthropogenic carbon" estimate from the age, and correlate it with the observed. 
2. Move the the ocean-circulation change run to see how much of the change is due to the age, how much is due to 
biogeochemistry changes. 
3. Then move on to the ocean heat uptake.

# Can you explain the differences in carbon uptake in the different mixing runs using the ventilation alone? 

Historical carbon and match it to age
