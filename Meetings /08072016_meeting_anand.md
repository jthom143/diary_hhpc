# Look at the CO2_doubling case for aredi=400 and aredi = 800. 
* Calculate the Anthropogenic CO2 (annual average). 
* Look at the time series of anthropogenic CO2 in the interior 
(somewhere in the SO where the difference is large).
* Take the derivative of the time-series to get something like a Transit 
Time Distribution. 
* We would expect there to be a long tail. 
* If you apply this TTD to the CO2 time-series
